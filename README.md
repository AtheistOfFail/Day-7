# Welcome to the OTB
We here at the Overwatch Terrorism Bureau are happy to induct you into our ranks.

You will be at forefront of anti-terrorism surveillance against both foreign and domestic aggressors.

You will be granted the ability to see everything and pursue every lead in order to ensure our country is safe at any cost.

See emails, transcribe phone calls, shopping histories and everything in an attempt to ensure terrorists are brought to Justice


# First assignment
You will receive a brand new assignment from your handler.

Whether it be a whisteblower, tapped phone call or hacked email, you will be given the first suspect.

Attempt to unravel the plot and arrest/extort the truth. Only you can prevent a catastrophe.


# Resources
Your resources are not endless. 

Hacking phones and high grade encryption is time-consuming and if they're only using it to text dirty pictures, you may find yourself out of time.

Ensure you keep the suspect list neat and only isolate important evidence.

Buying a couple of nails and a pressure cooker may be a smoking gun or evidence of that home renovation project that your suspect has put off for a couple of years.

Context is everything.

# Days
Days can run quickly (20 minutes realtime), so spend your resources, analyze every scrap of data and see if you can prevent a catastrophe

# Persons
Personal profiles are generated at game start for all people and relations to them.

Getting into the mind of the suspect will allow you to isolate dangerous individuals versus average people. 

Go deeper with criminal, citizenship, immigration, driving, education, employment, financial, medical and military records.

# Suspects
Are you sure that guy is innocent or are you just thinking he is?

Bring him in for a conversation, see how it goes. If you're not sure, why not just give him a bit of water? 

It's all for a good cause.
